How would I ensure fast retrieval of overdue loans? 
The code of the performance is located in the SQL QUERIES/SQL CODE FOLDER/ -10-explainBlock.sql

I personally think the fastest way to get all instances of the overdue loans is
just to based off the status whether it's overdue or not. I see overdue as 'pass the due date and not returned'
others could argue that a loan may still hold the 'overdue' status even when it is returned. 

I just run an update block where i check if there is the return_date column is null (meaning the user has
not returned the book) and check whether the current date is before or after the due date, then I'll decide on the status
then. The code referencing this approach is (SQL QUERIES / SQL CODE FOLDER / -06- updateStatus.sql)
