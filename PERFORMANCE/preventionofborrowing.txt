How would I prevent the user from borrowing a book that already has a quantity of 0?

I would use a more BackEnd approach. That is the logic will be applied on the Backend and it will
handle the exceptions. I would probably handle it by selecting the quantity column from the Books table
and then checking whether it's zero or not. If it's zero, I'll handle it by raising an exception, 
if it's not zero then I'll run the insert BookLoan query to create a new instance of BookLoan. 

I know that there are database triggers, but at the moment i prefer the above method. 
the psuedo code located in the same folder is referenced (handleZero.ts)

For the updating of the values, it is handled by the 07-updateQuantity.sql block found in the 
SQL QUERIES/ SQL CODE folder
